# Stuff I Want to Say to the Students but Haven't Categorized Yet
===

- Design's effectivness can be observed and sometimes measured. You can always weigh your decisions against questions of intent, content, and audience. This is a beautiful gift and should not be taken for granted.
- Graphic design has no rules. It does, however, have a rich history of successful and unsuccessful work that we will study and learn from. I will teach you what usually works and why (the why is very important), and your job as a designer is to decide what is right for each project.
- Your projects will be focused on ideas and process, not specific skills. I will not assign you 'hand turkey' projects.
- Do not be concerned with building a portfolio at this point in your life. By the time you graduate you'll have grown so much that you wouldn't dream of including any work from sophomore year in your portfolio. You'll wish you had focused on having fun and taking risks.
