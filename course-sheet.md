## Projects

### Website

Every week, students will be responsible for documenting their work and putting the documentation onto their personal website, which will be built in the first week alongside the first assignment. This documentation can take the form of photography, video, audio, screenshots, writing, or computer generated graphics. Grades will be based solely on the documentation of the work. Students may bring physical props to supplement the documentation, but an undocumented project will receive a failing grade.

In addition to completing the assignment each week, students will be responsible for adapting and improving their personal website to accomodate the latest work. At the end of the semester, students will have a complete website featuring all of the work they produced over the course of GD 1 that has been through 16 design iterations.

After updating the website each week, students must also document the website itself, either with a series of screenshots or a short screencast. This documentation should be consistent each week to highlight the differences in the website itself.
