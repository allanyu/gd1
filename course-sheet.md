## How the Class is Conducted

## Standards / Expectations / Grading Criteria

Students will be expected to show up on time every week, exceed the requirements of each project, and actively participate in discussions.



## Schedule

This is where the schedule will go.



## Projects


### Website

Every week, students will be responsible for documenting their work and putting the documentation onto their personal website, which will be built in the first week alongside the first assignment. This documentation can take the form of photography, video, audio, screenshots, writing, or computer generated graphics. Grades will be based solely on the documentation of the work. Students may bring physical props to supplement the documentation, but an undocumented project will receive a failing grade.

In addition to completing the assignment each week, students will be responsible for adapting and improving their personal website to accomodate the latest work. At the end of the semester, students will have a complete website featuring all of the work they produced over the course of GD 1 that has been through 16 design iterations.

After updating the website each week, students must also document the website itself, either with a series of screenshots or a short screencast. This documentation should be consistent each week to highlight the differences in the website itself.

Learning:
- HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- An understanding of iterative design, specifically as it applies to the web
- How to properly and thoroughly document design work
- Maintainability and best practices for asset management

Things to consider:
- How can I best tailor my website to my work and the way in which it is documented?
- What decisions can I make that will make me more likely to update my site regularly?
- How can I make it easy to change the design of my site without creating a lot of manual labor for myself?


### Self-Portrait

Create a self-portrait in black and white. Use this as an opportunity to teach the rest of the class something interesting and unique about yourself. Avoid simple facts, or any information about yourself that others may already know.

Learning:
- Basic CSS
- How to use the web inspector

### Monograph

Share something you have special knowledge or expertise on in a concise way. This can be a publication, book, website, or something else, as long as it has a clear beginning and end. You are reponsible for authoring, creating, collecting, and curating all of the content in the monograph.


### Giving

A good designer should be an excellent gift giver. Give a gift to someone in your life. This gift must not be for an occasion or otherwise expected. Document your process, the gift itself, and (if non-intrusive) the delivery of and response to the gift.

Learning:
- How to be conscious of your audience
- How to use your skills and knowledge to do something good.

Things to consider:
- What gift are you uniquely suited to give?
- What audience do you know in a unique way?

### Nemesis

Create a brand that is in direct competition with a prominent, existing company. Carefully choose a company and a market that you have some knowledge or experience with, or that is badly in need of a new voice. Think about the practical considerations of your brand and realize that what will set your ficticious company apart will not be color, typography, or a logo. Be bold and indulgent. Design the kind of company you want to exist in the world.

Learning:
- The complexity, compromise, and interconnectedness of branding
- How to identify a product or service's unique position in a market and represent that position visually
- How to construct and present a complete and thorough brand

Things to consider:
- "The well designed X" is not an acceptable competitive edge. Try harder.
- Painting colored lines and shapes on existing products is not an acceptable competitive edge, either.

### Love Letters

Over the course of the semester, each student will be responsible for sharing something they love with the class. This can be just about anything, such as a book, album, person, place, time, film, product, or something else altogether. Share with the class in a way that makes the most sense for what you're sharing.

The first week of class I will present something I love to the class.

Learning:
- Public speaking
- How to talk about art and design positively
- How to tailor medium to message
- All about the things your peers and classmates love
