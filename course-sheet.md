## Projects


### Website

Every week, students will be responsible for documenting their work and putting the documentation onto their personal website, which will be built in the first week alongside the first assignment. This documentation can take the form of photography, video, audio, screenshots, writing, or computer generated graphics. Grades will be based solely on the documentation of the work. Students may bring physical props to supplement the documentation, but an undocumented project will receive a failing grade.

In addition to completing the assignment each week, students will be responsible for adapting and improving their personal website to accomodate the latest work. At the end of the semester, students will have a complete website featuring all of the work they produced over the course of GD 1 that has been through 16 design iterations.

After updating the website each week, students must also document the website itself, either with a series of screenshots or a short screencast. This documentation should be consistent each week to highlight the differences in the website itself.

### Monograph

Share something you have special knowledge or expertise on in a concise way. This can be a publication, book, website, or something else, as long as it has a clear beginning and end. You are reponsible for authoring, creating, collecting, and curating all of the content in the monograph.


### Giving

Give a gift to someone in your life. This gift must not be for an occasion or otherwise expected. Document your process, the gift itself, and (if non-intrusive) the delivery of and response to the gift.

Skills learned:
- How to be conscious of your audience
- How to use your skills and knowledge to do something good.


### Nemesis

Create a brand that is in direct competition with a prominent, existing company. Carefully choose a company and a market that you have some knowledge or experience with, and that is badly in need of a new voice. Think about the practical considerations of your brand and realize that what will set your ficticious company apart will not be color, typography, or a logo. Be bold and indulgent. Design the kind of company you want to exist in the world.
