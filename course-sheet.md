## Course Description

The goal of this course is to teach you to think like a designer, to approach the world with a critical eye, and to arm you with skills and processes that traverse specific tools and media. It is most important that you have fun and learn as much as possible.

The class will consist of many, smaller projects as opposed to fewer, larger ones. This will allow you to take risks, fail quickly, and go through the design process in it's entirety multiple times throughout the course of the semester. Assignments will be focused on ideas and process. You will not be assigned 'hand-turkey' projects. Fundamentals will be taught through example when reviewing work.

For many of the assignments, the format will be left up to you. This is an opportunity to showcase your unique skills and interests (printmaking, illustration, bookbinding, building websites, etc.) but you will also be expected to work outside of your comfort zone.



## Supplies / Must Haves

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) Account
- [GitHub for Mac](http://mac.github.com/)
- [Espresso for Mac](http://macrabbit.com/espresso/) (if you are experienced with CSS and already have a preferred text editor, please let me know)
- [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
- Chrome (Browser)
- A backup service, such as [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) or [Backblaze](http://www.backblaze.com/) — I have a zero tolerance policy for "lost/corrupted files" as an excuse for late or incomplete work.



## How the Class is Conducted

Your peer network and community at MICA are some of the most valuable assets to your education. We will all meet, in person, every week to maximize in-class time.

Each class will consist of some combination of the following:
- One or more 'Love Letter' presentations
- Overview of new assignments
- Review and discussion of in progress or completed work
- A short workshop on technique, software skills, or code

Critiques will be done in a "pin-up" style. Letter-sized printouts of everyone's work will be hung on the wall and the discussion will be high level, touching on the most and least successful work, as well as themes shared throughout. When the class has identified something they want to discuss further, the work will be pulled up on the student's website on the projector. Everything represented on the printouts should be posted to the student's website and vise-versa.



## Standards / Expectations / Grading Criteria

You will be expected to show up on time every week, exceed the requirements of each project, and actively participate in discussions. Your work should reflect your unique skills and perspective. You should demonstrate a desire to learn and improve your craft. You will be expected to juggle multiple projects at the same time.

You will be graded on the effort you put into your projects, your participation in class discussions, your responsiveness to feedback, and your improvement as a designer over the course of the class.

You grade will be broken down by project as follows:

- Personal Archive: 30%
- Love Letter: 5%
- Self-Portrait: 5%
- Giving: 5%
- The Pen is Mightier: 5%
- Nemesis: 15%
- Become the Master: 15%
- Monograph: 20%

## Projects


### Personal Archive

Every week, you will be responsible for documenting your work and putting the documentation onto your personal website, which will be built in the first week alongside the first assignment. This documentation can take the form of photography, video, audio, screenshots, writing, or computer generated graphics. Grades will be based solely on the documentation of the work. You may bring physical props to supplement the documentation, but an undocumented project will receive a failing grade.

In addition to completing the assignment each week, you will be responsible for adapting and improving your personal website to accomodate the latest work. At the end of the semester, you will have a complete website featuring all of the work you produced over the course of GD 1 that has been through 16 design iterations.

Learning:
- HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- An understanding of iterative design, specifically as it applies to the web
- How to properly and thoroughly document design work
- Maintainability and best practices for asset management

Things to consider:
- How can I best tailor my website to my work and the way in which it is documented?
- What decisions can I make that will make me more likely to update my site regularly?
- How can I make it easy to change the design of my site without creating a lot of manual labor for myself?

### Love Letter

Over the course of the semester, you and each of your classmates will be responsible for sharing something you love with the class. This can be anything creative, such as a book, album, person, place, time, film, product, or something else altogether. Present it in a way that makes the most sense for what you're sharing. Your presentation should be about 10 minutes in length.

We will start off class with one, or when necessary two, Love Letter presentations every week. You will sign up ahead of time for a slot.

Learning:
- How to give a presentation
- How to talk about art and design positively
- How to tailor medium to message
- About the things your peers and classmates love

Things to consider:
- What do you know about the origins of your subject?
- What can we learn about design from your subject?

### Selfie

Create a self-portrait in black and white. Use this as an opportunity to teach the rest of the class something interesting and unique about yourself. Avoid simple facts, or any information about you that others may already know. This is a rare opportunity to make a completely considered first impression; don't waste it.

Learning:
- How to work quickly
- How your peers identify themselves

Things to consider:
- Would my friends or loved ones recognize this as me if they saw it out of context?
- In what ways are you similar to the other people in the classroom? In what ways are you distinct? Focus on the latter.

### It's the Thought that Counts

A good designer should be an excellent gift-giver. Give a gift to someone in your life. This gift must not be for an occasion or otherwise expected. Document your process, the gift itself, and (if non-intrusive) the delivery of and response to the gift.

Learning:
- How to be conscious of and connect with your audience
- How to use your skills and knowledge to do something good
- How and why to choose a certain format
- Design is often about an experience, not an object

Things to consider:
- What gift are you uniquely suited to give?
- Who do you know in a special way?

### The Pen is Mightier

Prepare a written critique of a piece of design in the news (I will provide a list of options the day the assignment is given). We will use everyone's written piece as a jumping off point for an in class critique. It is more important that your criticism be thoughtful and enlightening than your writing be exceptionally creative or high quality. Refer to the provided guidelines when writing your criticism.

Learning:
- How to write intelligently about design
- Awareness of the complex considerations behind every piece of design

Things to consider:
- Can my criticism be informed by any special knowledge or experience I have? What unique perspective can I provide?

### Nemesis

Create a brand that is in direct competition with a prominent, existing company. Carefully choose a company and a market that you have some knowledge or experience with, or that is badly in need of a new voice. Think about the practical considerations of your brand and realize that what will set your ficticious company apart will not be simply color, typography, or a logo. Be bold and indulgent. Design the kind of company you want to exist in the world. The "well designed version of X" is not an acceptable competitive edge, nor is painting colorful shapes or lines on existing products. Try harder.

Learning:
- The complexity, compromise, and interconnectedness of branding
- How to identify a product or service's unique position in a market and represent that position visually
- How to construct and present a complete and thorough brand

Things to consider:
- How is your nemesis distinct from the consumer's perspective? Do you need to educate them in some way before they can understand your brand's position?
- In what ways should your brand look similar to existing brands in your market? In what ways should it look different?

### Become the Master

Use your design skills to teach something you're specially qualified to teach. Your goal should be for everyone that views your work to learn something new and retain this knowledge. Focus on something simple but unique, such as the unique way you fold your shirts, or the most effective way to cut an onion. The viewer should feel good if they are able to learn something from your project.

Learning:
- Designing for a specific outcome
- How to make the unfamiliar digestible
- How to choose a medium to maximize for communication
- The value of user-testing
- How to measure the success of a piece of design in the real world

Things to consider:
- How can you teach the most people with the least amount of effort? How can you teach the least people with the most effort? What are the trade-offs of each?
- How will written language make it easier for you to get your message across? How will it make it harder?

### Monograph

Share something you have special knowledge or expertise on in a concise way. The format can be a publication, book, website, or something else, as long as it has a clear beginning and end. You are reponsible for authoring, creating, collecting, or curating all of the content in the monograph.
