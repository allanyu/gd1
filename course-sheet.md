## Projects

### Website

Every week you will be responsible for documenting your work and putting the documentation onto your personal website, which will be built in the first week alongside your first assignment. This documentation can take the form of photography, video, audio, screenshots, writing, or computer generated graphics. Your grade will be based solely on the documentation of the work. You may bring physical props to supplement the documentation, but an undocumented project will receive a failing grade.

In addition to completing your assignment each week, you will be responsible for adapting and improving your personal website to accomodate the latest work. At the end of the semester, you will have a complete website featuring all of the work you produced over the course of GD 1.
